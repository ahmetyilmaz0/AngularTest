# AngularTest
Random string generator and configure the generation and display of values every 3 seconds.

Task is to create a random string generator.  Each value must be 5 characters long.

 Configure the generation and display of values ​​every 3 seconds.

 When displaying the display value to the user, fulfill the following conditions:
 1) if the created value is a palindrome, display it in red;
 2) if the created value consists only of numbers, display it in blue;
 3) if the created contains 0 do not display it at all.

 Use RxJs when setting the display every 3 seconds.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
